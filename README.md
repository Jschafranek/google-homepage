This is going to be my example of the Google search page when you browse to Google.com.

Dec 10th 2020 Google Search Page is COMPLETE.

Started by building the html elements and getting everything on the page before styling it. I followed instructions as TOP suggested. Add the logo, searchbar and buttons. Then move onto the header and the content that belongs their. And finishing the set up with the footer similar to the header. Once all elements were added, styling was put into effect. I tried to closley replicate the buttons and colors of the page by using developer tools to acheive the outcome. I used flexbox to properly align and place everything in a way that made sense. 

This is was fun first project as I learned to build using React and not Pure HTML/CSS.
